Well done!

Row number is returning unique number for each row, but to have unique numbers for rank and dense_rank you need to have unique values in each row (for column that you use in PARTITION BY).

a)
Seems that you first inserted values from the next tasks. :)

b)
You can insert multiple rows by having it divided by comma, like this:
INSERT INTO Production.UnitMeasure
VALUES 
('TT1', 'Test1', '2020-09-09'),
('TT2','Test2',GETDATE())

f)
I expected using ISNULL function for TerritoryGroup for replacing nulls, but technically you were right.

g)
Sql server can't understand which day is a holiday :))

Please, recalculate count(id).
