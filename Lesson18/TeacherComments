Well done!

1. -1
You should have specified the join conditions. In your solution you have cross join.

2. -0.5
The task is totally solvable without window functions.

3. -0.5
We need to have one. And only the name.
Possible solution: 
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES region_name
FROM Employees e JOIN Departments d ON dep.department_id=emp.department_id
	JOIN Locations l ON d.location_id=l.location_id
	JOIN Countries c ON l.country_id=c.country_id
	JOIN Regions r ON c.region_id=r.region_id 
GROUP BY region_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC

4. 
All can be calculated in the one query.

5.-1.5
Possible solution:
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, DATEDIFF(year, start_date, ISNULL(end_date, GETDATE())) as exp
FROM Employees e JOIN Job_history jh ON e.employee_id=jh.employee_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(year, start_date, ISNULL(end_date, GETDATE()))>10

6. Better use dense_rank.
